# 🧚 Gracile

A thin, full-stack, **web** framework.

Features:

- Portable **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**, thanks to **Lit (SSR)**.
- Highly responsive during dev. and build, thanks to **Vite**.
- **Minimal dependency footprint** for its **runtime** and your **distributable**.
- Embrace web standards like **Custom Elements** (aka Web Components) or the **WhatWG Fetch** API.
- A streamlined **D**eveloper e**X**perience for building, instead of fiddling around.

# 🏁 Get Started

Bootstrap a project with the `create gracile@latest` command:

```
npm create gracile@latest
pnpm create gracile@latest
bun create gracile@latest
yarn create gracile@latest
```

## 🌐 A platform-minded meta-framework

Gracile is powered by **Vite** and **Lit SSR**.

With it, you can achieve:

- File-based routing
- **S**erver **S**ide **R**endering
- **S**tatic **S**ite **G**eneration
- **Server** integration (`Request`/`Response`) for **Express**
- Full-stack **Custom Elements** (Lit), with hydration
- **Content** websites
- Multi or Single Page **Applications**
- Progressive enhancements
- And more, via **Add-ons** (Markdown, Metadata, SVG…)

All that, with a **few conventions**, a **standard-oriented** approach and a very **contained footprint** 🤏.

Web Components, TypeScript, SASS, Lit, and other DX perks are all at your fingertips; while remaining optional.

Thanks to the Vite modular architecture, and Node.js versatility, **developer experience** is smoothed up
across the board, while in **development** and when building for **production**.
