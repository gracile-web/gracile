# Gracile

A thin, full-stack, **web** framework.

---

## A platform-minded meta-framework

Gracile is powered by **Vite** and **Lit SSR**.

With it, you can achieve:

- File-based routing
- Server Side Rendering
- Static Site Generation
- Server handler backend integration (`Request`/`Response`)
- Full-stack Custom Elements (Lit), with hydration
- Content websites
- Multi or Single Page Applications
- Progressive enhancements
- And more, via Add-ons (Markdown, Metadata, SVG…)

All that, with a **few conventions**, a **platform-minded** approach and a very **contained footprint** 🤏.

Web Components, TypeScript, SASS, Lit, etc. are all at your fingertips; while remaining optional.

Thanks to the Vite modular architecture, and Node.js versatility, **developer experience** is smoothed up
across the board, while in **development** and when building for **production**.
