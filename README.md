# 🧚 Gracile

A thin, full-stack, **web** framework.

Features:

- Portable **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**, thanks to **Lit (SSR)**.
- Highly responsive during dev. and build, thanks to **Vite**.
- **Minimal dependency footprint** for its **runtime** and your **distributable**.
- Embrace web standards like **Custom Elements** (aka Web Components) or the **WhatWG Fetch** API.
- A streamlined **D**eveloper e**X**perience for building, instead of fiddling around.

# 🏁 Get Started

Bootstrap a project with the `create gracile@latest` command:

```
npm create gracile@latest
pnpm create gracile@latest
bun create gracile@latest
yarn create gracile@latest
```

## 🌐 A platform-minded meta-framework

Gracile is powered by **Vite** and **Lit SSR**.

With it, you can achieve:

- File-based routing with efficient code-splitting
- **S**erver **S**ide **R**endering
- **S**tatic **S**ite **G**eneration
- **Server** integration (`Request`/`Response`) for **Express**, **Hono**…
- Full-stack **Custom Elements** (Lit), with hydration
- **Content** websites
- Multi or Single Page **Applications**
- Progressive enhancements (no JS fallbacks, smart hydration…)
- And more, via **Add-ons** (Markdown, Metadata, SVG…)

All that, with a **few conventions**, a **standard-oriented** approach and a very **contained footprint** 🤏.

Web Components, TypeScript, SASS, Lit, and other DX perks are all at your fingertips; while remaining optional.

Thanks to the Vite modular architecture, and Node.js versatility, **developer experience** is smoothed up
across the board, while in **development** and when building for **production**.

## Ease of use

Write the same markup, styling and scripting languages for both server and
client side.  
The ones that you already know and use everywhere else: **HTML**, **CSS** and
**JavaScript**.

Simplicity doesn't mean obfuscation. You're still in charge without abandoning flexibility to your framework.

## Standards oriented

Built with a platform-minded philosophy. Every time a standard can be leveraged
for a task, it should be.  
It also means fewer vendor-specific idioms to churn on and a more portable
codebase overall.  
Stop re-implementing the wheel, and embrace **future-proof APIs**, you'll thank
yourself later!

## Developer Experience

The DX bar has been constantly raised, alongside developers' expectations about
their everyday tooling.  
The "Vanilla" community is full of gems, in a scattered way.  
Gracile provides an integrated, **out-of-the-box** experience while keeping
non-core opinions as _opt-ins_.

## Convention over configuration

Finding the right balance between **convenience** and **freedom** is tricky.  
Hopefully, more and more patterns will be established in the full-stack JS
space.

Gracile is inspired by those widespread practices that will make you feel at
home.

## Light and unobtrusive

All in all, the Gracile framework is just Vite, Lit SSR and a very **restricted set of helpers and third parties**.  
Check its [dependency tree on npmgraph](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=@gracile/gracile), you'll see by yourself.  
Also, everything is done to **keep your Vite configuration as pristine as possible**. Augmenting an existing project can be done in a pinch, with no interference.

## Performances

**Speed is not the main goal** for Gracile, that's because it is just the sane
default you'll start with.  
Avoiding complex template transformations, or surgically shipping client-side JS
are just a few facets of what makes Gracile a "_do more with less_" power tool.
