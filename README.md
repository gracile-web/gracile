# Gracile

A thin, full-stack, **web** framework.

---

Gracile is a meta-framework powered by Vite and Lit SSR.

With it, you can achieve:

- Progressive enhancements
- Content websites
- Multi or Single Page Application
- Server Side Rendering
- Static Site Generation
- Server handler backend integration
- And more, via Add-ons (Markdown, Metadata, SVG…)

All that, with a **few conventions**, a **platform-minded** approach and a very **contained footprint** 🤏.
